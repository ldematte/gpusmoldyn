/***  LOOK-UP FUNCTIONS FOR REACTION RATES AND BINDING AND UNBINDING RADII  ***/
/******************************************************************************/

/* numrxnrate calculates the bimolecular reaction rate for the simulation
algorithm, based on the rms step length in step, the binding radius in a, and
the unbinding radius in b.  It uses cubic polynomial interpolation on previously
computed data, with interpolation both on the reduced step length (step/a) and
on the reduced unbinding radius (b/a).  Enter a negative value of b for
irreversible reactions.  If the input parameters result in reduced values that
are off the edge of the tabulated data, analytical results are used where
possible.  If there are no analytical results, the data are extrapolated.
Variable components: s is step, i is irreversible, r is reversible with b>a, b
is reversible with b<a, y is a rate.  The returned value is the reaction rate
times the time step delta_t.  In other words, this rate constant is per time
step, not per time unit; it has units of length cubed.  */

those values to 0, and returns the integral.  r is a vector of radii; r[0] may
equal zero but that is not required; if not, then it is assumed that the rdf has
zero slope at the origin.
   Integration uses a spherical version of the trapezoid rule: at positions r0
and r1, the function f has values f0 and f1, leading to the linear interpolation
f=[(r-r0)f1+(r1-r)f0]/(r1-r0).  Its integral is A=∫4πr^2f(r)dr
A=4π/(r1-r0)*[(f1-f0)/4*(r1^4-r0^4)+(r1f0-r0f1)/3*(r1^3-r0^3)]
A=π(f1-f0)(r1+r0)(r1^2+r0^2)+4π/3*(r1f0-r0f1)(r1^2+r1r0+r0^2)
The left end of the integral assumes zero slope for the rdf.  The right end does
not terminate exactly at 1, but includes the upper left triangle of the final
trapezoid.  That way, if there are two absorptions in a row, the second one will
return an integral of 0, and area is properly conserved.  The problem is that it
does not terminate exactly at 1.  Furthermore, the correct relative location of
1 between two r[j] points depends on the function.  The best solution is to use
an unevenly spaced r[j] vector, with a very narrow separation about 1 and no
r[j] equal to 1.   */
